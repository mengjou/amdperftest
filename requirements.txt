# Installation Instructions:
# 1. Create virtual environment: python -m venv venv
# 2. Activate virtual environment: 
#    - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
#    - Linux/WSL: source venv/bin/activate
# 3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 4. Verify installation: python test_wmi_gpu_cpu.py

# System Requirements:
# - Python 3.7 or higher
# - Windows 10/11 (for GPU monitoring)
# - WSL2 with Ubuntu/Debian (for NPU monitoring)
# - AMD GPU with recent drivers
# - AMD Software (for temperature monitoring)

# Note: Some dependencies are built into Python and don't need separate installation
